							<p>Personal trainer and athlete <strong>David Cross</strong> has a mission &mdash; a mission to get people eating well, training hard and living life the good way. He has been featured multiple times in publications such as <em>Men's Health</em>, <em>Men's Fitness</em> and <em>Sports Illustrated</em>, but as yet still had no online presence.</p>
							<p>David need a website, wanting to showcase his services and nutrition products online. He chose <strong>Build</strong> to fill that need.</p>

					<h2>A Simple, Effective Solution</h2>
						<p>David's reaction to using our editor was resoundingly positive &mdash; like many first-time users, he had the reaction of "I can't believe how easy this is to do."

						Within a couple of days of working on the site, he had his content laid out and working.</p>
						<p>Build's editor is so simple, if you have ever used a word processor like Microsoft Word, you already know how to use it. It's very easy for someone who knows nothing about web design to create a gorgeous website in no time.</p>

						<h2>Services Page</h2>
						<p>The chief reason for setting up David Cross' site was to expose his products to a larger audience. David needed a page to show the pricing list for his products and coaching services. Creating the page was simple &mdash; selecting the page template he wanted took seconds. After that, it was just a matter of replacing the content in the template with the pricing information for his products.</p>

						<p>When creating a website for your business, it's crucial to make it easy for your visitors to get in touch with you. Build has a built-in contact form that can be created and set up with a few clicks, and which will send contact e-mail addresses to your profile's e-mail address.</p>

								<p>I want to say a big thank you to the Build Team, their product, help and never too much hassle attitude when I was setting up my webpage was brilliant. I’m not completely useless when it comes to tech and websites but I often struggle with time and having to learn something new and build a site was not something I wanted to get involved in.</p>
								<p>I needn’t have worried. The Build platform was so easy to use, incredibly intuitive and really was a simple process from start to finish. I know people who have paid thousands for websites which don’t provide the same crisp and cleanness as my site, and they have to continue to pay to update the content. I just log on and make the adjustments as and when needed, it really was and is that simple.</p>
								<p>If I ever get stuck then their support and FAQ’s are very helpful, anything beyond that and I have no doubt they’ll be just as keen and helpful to sort any queries out. So far, I haven’t come up with anything they haven’t already covered.</p>
								<p>Thank you again to the team!</p>
