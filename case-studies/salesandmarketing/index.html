							<p>The New York and Los Gatos, California-based technology PR firm, <strong>@Sales and Marketing</strong>, has been based and has operated in California for a long time, and in that time has seen and done some great things with great companies.</p>
							<p>Building relationships with the right people takes a lot of time, as we can also attest&hellip; and you don't have that much time to maintain a website if you're in meetings and coffee shops. Luckily <strong>Build</strong> makes that so simple, <strong>@Sales and Marketing</strong> chose us for their web presence.</p>

					<h2>Easily Navigatable, Intuitive Website</h2>
						<p>Building a website in which you can find what you're looking for easily is incredibly important, but at the same time poorly understood by most people&hellip; and sometimes even professionals who build websites find it difficult! Luckily, Build makes it so simple and intuitive to build a website that even relatively complex brochure-style sites, like <strong>@Sales and Marketing</strong>, are simple to put together in as little as a few hours.</p>
						<p>On the home page of the site, you're presented with a summary of the services <strong>@Sales and Marketing</strong> offers, both in a slider at the top of the page and with more detail on the rest of it, as well as contact details and a portfolio slideshow further down. Any page on the website is easily accessible through the main menu's dropdowns.</p>

						<h2>Client Portfolio and Case Studies</h2>
						<p>With a client list as extensive as <strong>@Sales and Marketing's</strong>, you're going to need more than just a few pages to list them, let alone give your visitors details. Luckily, <strong>Build</strong> makes adding and organising pages a breeze.</p>
						<p>The site features two client lists, one for present clients and one for past clients, with an index for each showing the logos and branding of each client, and a link to their web site. Each client also has a case study page, which the visitor can view to read more about the relationships <strong>@Sales and Marketing</strong> has been building for their customers.</p>
						<p>These pages can all be accessed via dropdown on the home menu, a feature which <strong>Build</strong> automatically inserts when you have a sub-page for a main page. It's as easy as dragging and dropping these pages to reorder them.</p>
