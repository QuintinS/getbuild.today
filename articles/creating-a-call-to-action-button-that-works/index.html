						</div>

						<div class="post-intro">
							<p>Once you have hooked your audience, created a desire for your product; now you need to convince the potential customer to take the next step and show some commitment to your product. The Call to Action (CTA) button is one of the most important aspects of your marketing strategy and webpage. Visitors can only become loyal customers by engaging with your product or service. Websites can no longer rely on “Submit”, “Buy” or “Order Now” to convince customers to invest. You need an effective strategy to actually get visitors to click the CTA button.</p>

						</figure>

						<p>To create an effective CTA button it must have a clear benefit to the customer. You need to focus on how you are enhancing a person's life if they invest in your service or product. It needs to be compelling and enticing to the customer. You want to convert as many visitors to customers through your CTA. Once they have clicked the button it needs to cause action that will continue to create interest in your product or service.</p>

						<p>As already mentioned you want to emphasize to the customer what value your product or service will add to their life. What problem does your product or service solve? You need to present more than just a visually pleasing CTA button. Online shoppers have the ability to do extensive product research and look at multiple websites before making a purchase. This reinforces the importance of a good customer journey on your website leading up to the CTA. Attracting an online customer requires a build up of desire and interest in your company.</p>

						<blockquote class="banner info"><strong>Tip:</strong> Your CTA should emphasize that the customer is getting something rather than they are buying something that will cost them money. Change words to emphasize the benefit:</blockquote>

						<ul>
							<li><p>Use “Get” instead of “Order”</p></li>
							<li><p>Use personal an inclusive pronouns such as “My” rather than “Your”</p></li>
							<li><p>Add “Get Started” to your CTA to create urgent and immediate action.</p></li>
						</ul>

						<p>You want your CTA button to attract the customer's attention, but you don't want it to be so contrasted that it frightens them. Test different colors with the color scheme of your webpage. When designing all these aspects to your webpage always think about your target audience and what will appeal to them. </p>

						<p>There is no rule as to where the best position is to place your CTA button. Once again emphasizing the customer journey, you want to place your CTA button where the customer is most likely to make a rational and logical decision about purchasing your product or service. You want to think about when the customer would be ready to take the next step. Make sure you allow them enough time to analyze and recognize the benefits of your product or service. The more expensive and complex your product or service is; the more time and information the customer needs before making their decision.</p>

							<!-- </figcaption> -->
						</figure>

						<p>Sometimes you customer might need the little push of knowing the product may run out or they are getting the best deal at that moment. You don't want to over do it and scare the customer away, but adding words such as “today” or “right now” may optimize your CTA and cause the conversions you want to see.</p>

							</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>You don't want to overcomplicate your webpage so it overwhelms and confuses customers as to which CTA route they should be taking. Keep the ratio of one page to one CTA. This will help you keep their attention and focus the conversional goal of your page. If you have a long landing page you may consider having more than one CTA at different logical points. This can be effective as long as they only promote one purpose.</p>
