							<h2>What is Influencer Marketing?</h2>
							<p>It is when a company makes use of industry influencers to create appeal amongst their target audience as well as increasing your products exposure.  You can get an influencer to write a blog review on your product or service, or hosting an event where an influencer is a guest. This strategy can be quite costly as influencers will often charge you to promote your company. </p>
							<p>Here are some way you can reduce that cost and make your business stand out:</p>

						<p>You may think the best way to utilize influencer marketing is by using the biggest and best person. While this may help you get maximum exposure and is a good route, it can often be too expensive. Consider working with the newer influencers. They will charge you less and you may be able to forge a long-term relationship as you grow your businesses together.  You may be mutually beneficial to each other, which lowers the cost for you and makes the relationship more than just a business deal. In order to try and ensure that working with a smaller name will work out, try to find someone who has similar interests and desires as you and your brand.</p>

						<p>It may be easiest to just send an influencer an email requesting their assistance, but often meeting the influencer in person will have a bigger impact on them and thus they will want to work with you. Try to use events to meet influencers to create a more personal and memorable outreach. </p>

						<p>Once you know a bit about the person you want to work with and are in contact with them it may be a good idea to send them a gift. However you must act with caution, as sending the wrong person the wrong gift is sure to do more damage to the relationship than good. A good way to avoid this is sending someone a gift as a brand rather than an individual. This way can also give you a reason to send the influencer a tester of your product.</p>

						<p>You can catch the attention of the influencer you want to work with by mentioning them on your blog. This could be an entire post based on them. Or something smaller like quoting them or referring to an article they have written. Your aim is to catch their attention and show your admiration for them. However you don’t want to over do it and scare them off either. It is important to link them within the article to bring it to their attention. You may also want to be brave and tell them straight. This bold move may be what you need to start communications between your brand and the influencer. </p>

						<p>Facebook Ads allows you to target specific people with your campaign. If you have a cell phone number or email address for the people you with to target you can customize your audience. This is a way to reach a whole lot of influencers in one way.</p>

						</figure>

						<p>This is an easy way of showing your admiration for the person’s work, as well as providing them with a potential business venture. When sending a business referral consider how big the influencer is within the industry. If they are a big name then you need to balance the significance of the opportunity with that. Once you have referred someone make sure that person in turn mentions you and your brand to the influencer. If the influencer takes on the business you referred then follow up. Send them an email reminding them who you are and then suggest working together in the near future.</p>

						<p>Rework, improve and extended some of the content that the influencer has already written. This can be very impactful however you must act cautiously so as not to offend the person. Make sure you are polite towards them and ask their permission. If you want to forge a relationship with them in the future make sure you approach them and their work in a manner that highlights the importance of their original work.</p>
