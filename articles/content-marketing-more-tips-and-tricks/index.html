						<h2>Day 1</h2>

						<p>Let’s start at the beginning with the day you release your new content.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Email:</strong> you want to let your list know immediately so as to generate traffic. If you haven’t already, take a look at our “Quick Guide to Marketing your Brand”, and find out about keeping a centralized database.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Tip: </strong>Always include sharing buttons to get your audience to spread your content.
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Newletter –</strong> you can let your audience know about the new content through a newsletter. You can either sen the entire article to your email list (then they won’t click to your website to read it) or you can send a blurb with a link to the full article. </p>
										<p>
											<strong>Tip: </strong> Try making it personal to increase engagement. (Check out our <a href="/articles/effective-emails/">guide to writing effective emails</a>!)
										</p>	
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Promotional Email –</strong> these are useful for longer content. You may want to send an email that includes a blurb and highlights of the article and then use a CTA button that takes the reader to a landing page where they can opt-in to download the content.</p>
										<p>
											Have a look at our other articles, on <a href="/articles/landing-page-optimization/">Landing Page Optimization</a> and <a href="/articles/creating-a-call-to-action-button-that-works">creating CTA buttons</a> for some great tricks that will further boost your marketing campaign.
										</p>	
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Tweet: </strong>Use Twitter to promote your new content. However don’t make all your posts about your articles. Majority of your tweets should be non-promotional.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Google+: </strong>if you use Google+ to promote your brand then post the article on this social platform. Unlike Twitter you should only post once. You may want to consider using hashtags, tagging relevant people you may have mentioned and leaving a comment with the post.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Facebook: </strong>Post you article, just once, on Facebook. Again, think about writing a short comment to accompany it.</p>
								<p>(Alternatively take a look at <a href="/articles/promoting-content-facebook-ads/">how to use Facebook Ads to promote your content</a>)</p>
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>Week 1</h2>

						<p>Now lets look at how you should continue promoting your content in the week you first posted. The most important tip is to not post excessively.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Tweet –</strong> You can use Twitter to continue to promote your content. Again you don’t want all your tweets to seem like promotions. You can tweet more subtle promotions now. Instead of tweeting a direct link to the article try using a quote from the article, your thoughts on the content and how is has been received by your audience.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>LinkedIn –</strong> Post a link and introductory comment as a status update. You should also post it to relevant LinkedIn groups.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Share –</strong> Continue to share and comment about your new content on other social platforms you use. (Make sure you posting at the right times to maximize reach – if you need some guidelines check out <a href="/articles/optimisingsocialmedia">"Optimizing your Social Media Marketing"</a>)</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Respond –</strong> Keep engaging with your followers by responding directly to their comments and shares. This will help give your brand more of a personality.</p>
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>Continuous</h2>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Influence Marketers –</strong> Linking up with influential people within your industry can be an easy way to get your brand in front of a wide audience of the right people. (Start by reading our post to <a href="/articles/influencer-marketers-and-your-brand">get the most out of Influencer Marketing</a>) </p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>You want to have a list of people and brands that hold a lot of influence in your industry. Look for people who’s followers have a high engagement rate. You may want to use Technorati to help you find bloggers who value similar topics you want to promote. Folloerwonk.com can help you find tweeters in the same industry as you and connect with them. Your list should be as detailed as possible; include social profiles, email addresses, expertise, twitter handles, brands, and websites.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Categorize your identified influencers by their value level. You obviously want to start by targeting the higher value influencers.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Remember to always keep a record of your interactions with these people.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>You want to make personal contact with these people. Either through email of face to face at events. Once you have developed a relationship you can ask them to tweet about your product, mention you in a post or guest blog on your website.</p>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li><p><strong>Interact –</strong> keep in contact with your target influencers, your fans and other potential customers. Continue leaving comments on others blogs, tweets and posts. You also must keep replying to tweets and comments on your posts.</p></li>
						</ol>

						<h2>Power Up</h2>

						<p>Finally lets look at some strategies you can use to really make an impact.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Top 100 List –</strong> You may want to create a list on the top 100 influencers within your industry. This is also a great way to contact influencers. Let them know that you have included them. This may be the initial contact you need to get them to promote for you.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Survey or Report –</strong> Keep your audience updated and promote your brand by writing up reports on different aspects of your business. These can be annual reports that will help keep your fans engaged. You can also use your email list to send out a survey and collect valuable data about your audience. These findings can make up part of your report.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Training Program –</strong> If your brand is able to train more people in your field; you can use this authority and trust to create training programs. These courses should require enrollment and include a fee. At the end the trainee will benefit from the course and also receive certification of completing the courses. You will need to design and plan the course – think about materials and format of the program.</p>
							</li>
