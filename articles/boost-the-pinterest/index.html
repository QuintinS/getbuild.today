							<p>Pinterest is not utilized by businesses as much as other social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. However it has the ability to spread information amongst user as fast (if not faster) as those other sites. It even offers business accounts with specific features that are helping to quickly make it an important platform for online marketing.</p>

						<p>The Business account for Pinterest runs on a different Terms of Service, which is helpful in maximizing its marketing potential for your brand. It helps to keep spam to a minimum as well as stop businesses from clogging up followers’ feeds with endless repins and promotions.</p>
						<p>Further Pinterest offers interactive workshops and webinars that help educate you on using their site as an effective marketing tool. They also offer Analytics that gives you important tracking information. This information will help you boost your marketing strategy to effectively reach as many potential customers as possible.  </p>
						<p>If you join the Pinterest newsletter, you can be kept in the loop with all their new tools for businesses. For now they offer Rich Pins (allow for more information to boost your sales), Promoted Pins and a Widget Builder. You can also link your Facebook page to your Pinterest home page through a tab. </p>

						<p>The key to unlocking the power of Pinterest marketing is through popular pins. You want your pins to be engaging and repined, so make sure your content is searchable.  Following <strong>popular categories</strong> easily creates content that is search optimized. You can use the popular categories to utilize the correct boards on which you pin your advertisements. </p>
						<p>Remember that Pinterest is a <strong>visual</strong> site. Thus the images you post with your advert are key. Make sure images have a high resolution and clear. On average a lighter picture that does not contain a face is repined more often. Instructographics can also be effective in appealing to the D.I.Y culture that is popular on Pinterest. </p>

						<p>The optimal time to post on Pinterest depends on your target market. But a good rule to follow is during work break hours and late at night after work. The best time to post is on a Saturday morning. Another way to effectively get your customer repining your content is by sending it directly to them in an email newsletter. Use repining as a cell to action. </p>
						<p>Make sure it is easy to repin the content from your site. Your followers want a quick and user-friendly way to repin the posts they like. Use a “Pin It” button on any of your sites images. You want to maximize the spread of your content so it is ideal to connect with other social media platforms a well. Interconnect as many of your social profiles as possible. </p>
						<p>It is also important to make sure your posts are search engine optimized. This can be done simply by finding out what keywords, related to your business, are most popular. </p>

						<p>The most important aspect of online marketing is getting your content seen by your potential market. In order to strengthen your relationship with current followers as well as gain new followers, you need to post frequently. This keeps your brand relevant and in your viewers’ minds. But make sure your pins have a good spread. </p>
						<p>Keep up constant engagement with your followers by responding to comments. Increase customer service by directly addressing them and responding timeously. You may also want to reach out to your followers by leaving comments of their pins and engaging with popular boards. These more popular boards can provide an example for you of successful use of Pinterest.</p>
						<p>Be proactive in spreading your content and invite people to your boards. You can allow others to add pins to your board that is a good way to increase engagement with your brand. However you will still have overwriting power to make sure the posts are appropriate. </p>
						<p>Another way to proactively increase your board’s popularity is to reach out an already well-known influencer of your field. Try getting them to collaborate with you by guest posting on one of your boards. It is important you display to them your knowledge and interest in the field in order to convince them to help you.</p>

						<p>Take full advantage of Rich Pins. Rich Pins are the best tool for directly rowing your repins and optimizing your Pinterest sales strategy as they meant to be traffic-generating posts. They come in different categories which each offer different features. Thus you can choose the one, which will be most beneficial to your marketing. They offer live information that is updated in real-time.  They are most effective in directing more traffic to your website.</p>
						<p>Like most social media sites, people use them to be entertained. So you want to use a variety of content to keep viewers interested and engaged. While you want to keep your most popular board at the top, include some other boards that will keep your viewers interested. Another good way to keep your viewers and turning them to customers is by keeping your posts relevant. Be aware of upcoming holidays and events. </p>
						<p>One of the most important feature to include on your Pinterest site is a direct link to your website. The main use of social media platforms is to get more traffic on your website so make sure it is easy to get there. </p>
