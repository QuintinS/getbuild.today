						<p>The first thing you should know is you do have to pay a small fee to use Facebook Ads. However if the campaign successfully raises your conversion rates then it is well worth the money. You will need to choose the content you are going to promote through Facebook Ads. When creating or choosing the content try and find topic that will interest your audience and that is relevant for a long period of time. This will result in a higher click rate and more engagement. A strong, eye-catching headline will also help raise the click rate of the post. (Check out <a href="/articles/how-to-become-a-headliner-company">our guide on headlines</a> for tips on creating effective headlines).  </p>

						</figure>

						<p>When setting up your Facebook ad you first need to decide the format. There are several options offered by Facebook. Next you need to add an image. You will want to design this image to make maximum impact on your audience. The image needs to relate to the content as well. You can create your own image (check out Canva) or you can pay to have someone else create it for you (Try out Dribble).  </p>

						<h2>Tracking</h2>

						<p>It is suggested that you use <a href="articles/utilizing-google-analytics-utm-codes">UTM codes</a> as well as <a href="http://ww3.linktrackr.com/">Linktrackr</a> to stay up-to-date with the success of your ad campaign. Use Google Analytics and UTM codes to track your URL’s activity. Linktrackr gives a very detailed view of your different traffic sources. This online tool will be helpful when you want to put a stop to the ineffectual campaigns. If everything has been set up correctly both the sources should track your campaign similarly.</p>

						<h2>Targeting</h2>

						<figure class="content-image">
							<img src="images/screenshot-fb4.jpg" alt="Targeting" class="bordered width-100-percent">
						</figure>

						<p>You need to work out what outcome you are aiming to achieve with these paig Facebook Ads. Generally you are trying to create interest in and desire for your product. You should be looking to raise engagement with your brand rather than use them to make sales directly. Now you can decide how you are going to target this specific section of your audience. Facebook has a useful tool to help you find the right audience. Use Audience Insights to input the demographic of your target audience as well as the interests and similar likes. You want to find an audience that is at least over 200 000 people. If you are struggling try to broaden the interests you input. Try adding job titles, income, books etc.</p>

						<h2>Power Editor</h2>

						<figure class="content-image">
							<img src="images/screenshot-fb5.jpg" alt="Targeting" class="bordered width-100-percent">
						</figure>

						<p>This is different to the regular business manager. Once you have logged into the Power Editor you can choose how to optimize your traffic. Either use Clicks to Website or Website Conversions. The choice will depend on the goal you have set yourself. If one is showing bad results have a look at the other before you abandon the whole campaign. </p>

						<h2>Optimize</h2>

						<figure class="content-image">
							<img src="images/screenshot-fb6.jpg" alt="Optimize" class="bordered width-100-percent">
						</figure>

						<p>Before you make any decisions about the ad campaign give it a bit of time. Obviously you can abandon the campaign and save some money if it is definitely not working. Using the Business Manager you can check different metrics to weigh up the success or failure of the ads. Use “Performance and clicks” to check your click through rate and cost per click. This will help give you an indication on whether to continue running the ad campaign.</p>

						<p>You also need to keep checking your frequency. This refers to how often someone sees your advert. If this number increases by too much you cost per click will also increase. You need to re-evaluate the effectiveness of your ad campaign and adjust it accordingly to bring down those numbers. Try aim for a frequency below 2.</p>
