Hi Lyall,

So what is build, in 60 seconds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t15jXOzVNyU

So it makes prettier websites prove it:

Ok so it makes a better website, its more responsive for mobile phones ipads etc, it has a better price point and features: (See comparison) 
We also give $ 1000.00 in vouchers to users the moment they sign up, these are from our partners Google, Microsoft, Bidvertiser, Mirago, SoTrender, GraphicMail, 2checkout/ChaseManhatten etc etc.
Which puts us way ahead in value.

But the real money comes from transactions: This is as per our competitor Shoppify who charges $149 a month (what we charge a year) “our customers sell over 4 billion dollars worth of products” 

Now as you can verify Shoppify while still young is worth 1 billion dollars as are wix and Squarespace. The interesting thing with Shoppify is that it has 1/10th of the users because it makes money off transactions.
Now in this case we have a slightly better deal, we went to Chase manhatten and said hey we will only use you  (Shoppify uses lots of providers) they inturn said hey now we really want your business and not only offered us the same cut on transactions but also $49 to our users in credit for signing up to be used against transaction fees (added advantage).  There are 2 markets here, the great website market (Wix/Squarespace) and the Transaction market:

So how much is 4 billion dollars worth well if it is in the US: $ 10,000,000 
If its anywhere else in the world:  $20,000,000 according to 2checkout that was over 4 months.

So if 2checkoutout/Chase Manhattan believes in the product so much can you prove it:  I can do better than that, I have attached the contract from them. (I have also attached infographics on what the transactions on ecommerce market is worth right now). I can also forward mails from them stating just how excited they are ? also attached a comment from Googles head of enterprise in SA, Brett St. Clair which you can find live on twitter as well.

Ok so Microsoft, Google, Facebook, love what you guys are doing, what is second round funding worth on companies like this, well as per crunchbase these companies all took between $20-36 million for between 20 and 30% stake. (in wixes case I presume this is because they have a staff of 380, I built a better product with just me and 2 assistants)

So how much stake are you willing to give up and what sort of premium would you give to make it happen now (how much of a hit are you willing to take Craig) . I would like to move 10%. I am willing to do this out of my own equity (my current total 50%) for $ 4.5 million. (split 1 million to myself so that I have something at least for the massive hit and can ensure salary for the 24 months as cover any unforeseen out of my own pocket, 3.5 million to be used directly into the business for aggressive marketing to gain users. I would like to accelerate our acquisition to 100K users.)

Exit strategy, I have to be honest at 100,000 users it would put our valuation well into the 1 billion category (as you can verify looking at our competitors) just like everyone else (this would be a solid business, not a wow sale like Whatsapp), I would like to achieve that in less than 24 months, and my intent would be to step down as CEO/CTO and to sell my remaining share, and be happy, it would be more than enough money for me. That is why I want to take VC to boost users acquisition and traction, enough to force one of the other players to have to buy us.

Thank you for taking the time to look at this.
Craig
