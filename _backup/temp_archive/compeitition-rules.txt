COMPETITION TERMS AND CONDITIONS TEMPLATE
Social Competitions are great for engaging your audience, driving traffic to your site and growing a new network of followers. 

However, while competitions are often thought of as 'run of the mill', whenever you ask audience members to 'enter for a chance to win' you have stepped into the zone of the 'legally regulated competition'.

When running a competition you must make sure before you run your competition, you communicate the terms and conditions, such as who is eligible, what the prizes are, the time frame for the contest, and how will winners be determined.
